#### How to
1. Get the black cable[^cablenote] and the jack ear/headphones.
2. Insert the black cable on ```GND``` and in the bottom-most part of the ear/headphone jack.
3. Get the red cable.
4. Insert the red cable in ```0``` and in the tip of the ear/headphone jack.
5. Press <font style="color:red;">A</font> and enjoy!











[^cablenote]: The crocodile cables should be in the box. If not, than the project would not work unless you have new microbit with built-in speaker (not fun).
